TODO:
* Where is the UI for this new catalog?
* Test creating the *.zip file (see calibre-mendeley-plugin)
* Rename the git repository to have "calibre" in the name
* Write README
* License

* For different templated files:
1.- On generate the plugin: create a file with the list of files in templates/* (with subdirs!)
2.- When reading: open the list of files
3.- Then load the files in that list of files
4.- Parse each file there?
